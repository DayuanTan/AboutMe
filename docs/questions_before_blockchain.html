        <p>Blockchain cannot do anything. In most cases, you don't need a blockchain. But for the things it does well, it's unprecedented.</p>
        <p>Before you decide to use blockchain for your projects, you should consider below questions.</p>
        
        <hr>

        <div class="articleheader1">1. Do you need to store data in your project?</div>
        <hr>
        <p>Blockchain is a distributed ledger, aka a distributed data storage system. If you don't use any data in your project, then you don't need a blockchain.</p>
        <p>Someone may say blockchain is a database which is not accurate. A mature database (e.g., Oracle, MySQL, etc.) has many requirements, like quick query speed for even large amount of data. What to store on blockchain should be carefully chose. </p>
          
          

        <hr>
        <div class="articleheader1">2. Are there multiple parties, who contribute data, in your project? </div>
        <hr>
        <p>One main benefit blockchain brings is the trust between multiple parties. If your project only involves yourself, then you don't need a blockchain. If you know and trust each other then you don’t need a blockchain. In this case may be a central or distributed system work well for you. </p>

        <p>The parties can be organizations, or departments of one organization, or any parts of one team, if you don’t have 100% trust in each other. For example, the manufacturing department and quality control department.</p>
        <p>Those multiple parties should have the need to contribute data. If there are multiple parties but only one contribute data (like a static webpage), then you don’t need a blockchain. Only when multiple parties need to write into the data storage system, you should continue considering blockchain. </p>

        <hr>
        <div class="articleheader1">3. Do all parties trust a third party over blockchain?</div>
        <hr>
        <p>If your answer to the second question is Yes, then there are two solutions: hiring an all trusted third party or using blockchain.</p>

        <p>In many cases, you can find a third party trusted by all parties. In this case you don’t need a blockchain. For example, when you transfer some money to your friend, you, your bank, your friend, and their bank all trust in SWIFT (or ACH or any other systems). When you buy a product from a seller on Amazon, you and the seller both trust in Amazon. You place the order and pay for it, but your seller cannot get your payment immediately. These money you paid are transferred to Amazon. The seller can get your payment after the package has been delivered.</p>

        <p>If you cannot find a third party trusted by all, or you choose blockchain over third party, then it’s time to consider using blockchain.</p>

        <hr>
        <div class="articleheader1">4. What problem blockchain is used to solve in your project? Or what benefits blockchain solution brings to your project?</div>
        <hr>

        <p>This is the question which is easily forgotten by people to think about. In some cases, what you pursue doesn’t need a blockchain. In other words, some parts of blockchain technologies can solve it. For example, sometimes you only need the property of immutability, then maybe an immutable centralized database is enough; sometimes you only want the failure tolerance, then a traditional distributed system with a byzantine fault tolerance is enough; sometimes you only need to secure your data, then how about just using cryptography without blockchain?</p>


        <hr>
        <div class="articleheader1">5. How blockchain will be used in your project? How is that better than non-blockchain solutions? </div>
        <hr>
        <p>Now you need to consider the architecture of your project and how blockchain will be used in your project. More specifically, </p>
        <ul>
          <li>who will be nodes? </li>
          <li>which data you want to store on and off the blockchain? </li>
          <li>what features you want the smart contract (code on blockchain) to implement? </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Then you must consider the question that is there any non-blockchain solution for your project? If no, then go ahead with blockchain. If yes, how the blockchain solution is better than those non-blockchain solutions?  </p>

        <p>After answering above questions, I believe you have your answer whether blockchain is suitable for your project. These questions help to confirm you really need this technology instead of following suit. </p>
