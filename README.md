# 1. My Github Repos

## 1.1 Open Source Academic Research

All of my open source academic researches, actually most of my academic researches, are listed [here](https://github.com/DayuanTan/OpenSourceAcademicResearch).


## 1.2 Algorithms and Practices, Leetcode
[AlgorithmsAndPractices](https://github.com/DayuanTan/AlgorithmsAndPractices)

## 1.3 Practice Projects

### 1.3.1 [Tasks List](https://github.com/DayuanTan/app_tasks_list)
A tasks list management application. User can create, delete, sort tasks, and add date, mark as important, check/uncheck for each task.


## 1.4 Course Projects

### 1.4.1 [Advanced Operating System class projects: ](https://github.com/DayuanTan/DistributedSystemDesign)
Project 1: Socket. Create a new thread for each client connection.

Project 2: Design a distributed system.


### 1.4.2 [Script Languages: Web based pokemon game](https://github.com/DayuanTan/pokemon_web_game):
A web based pokemon game. Gamers can capture, train pokemon sprites and fight against other polemon sprites.


### 1.4.3 [Wireless Sensor Network: RSSI-based Localication using four sensors](https://github.com/DayuanTan/CMSC684wsn):
Use RSSI to locate sensors. All sensor nodes broadcast signals. One node receives their signals and sends the RSSI information to PC via serial port. PC uses thies RSSI information to locate other sensor nodes.

### 1.4.4 [Advanced Computer Architecture: Improve the performance from architecture perspective for a KNN-stock-price-prediction program](https://github.com/DayuanTan/knn_predictprice):
Phase 1: Pre-process stock price data; Use KNN to predict stock price. 

Phase 2: **Optimize the performance by *Floating Point Squaring, Cache Resizing* and *Branch Prediction***.
[Report here](https://github.com/DayuanTan/knn_predictprice/blob/master/CMSC%20611%20Project%20Report.pdf).

### 1.4.5 [Computer Architecture: Design your ISA and Hardware; Test using Quartus (ModelSim)](https://github.com/DayuanTan/ComputerArchitecture)

Design an instruction set and overall architecture (ISA) for a special-purpose reduced instruction set (RISC) processor. Design the hardware for the processor core.

3. [Frontend only storage methods: Indexed DB, LocalStorage. (Sqlite needs backend server)](https://github.com/DayuanTan/sqlite_example).

4. [JS_customElement_shadowDOM_eg:](https://github.com/DayuanTan/JS_customElement_shadowDOM_eg)
Show how to use Javascript customElement and shadow DOM.

5. [Learn crawling data from quora](https://github.com/DayuanTan/learn_crawl_quora).
Use BeautifulSoup4 etc. to crawl questions and answers about Bitcoin from quoral.

6. [Python data analysis and display](https://github.com/DayuanTan/OlympicAthlete): 
Use python numpy, pandas, matplotlib.pyplot and seaborn to do some data analysis and display.
