Github Pages supports building from the /docs folder in the main branch, so the source code file is named as "docs", not "src" following Software Engineering convention.

This website uses Jekyll and Github Pages.

[Jekyll](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/about-github-pages-and-jekyll) is a static site generator with built-in support for GitHub Pages. Jekyll takes Markdown and HTML files and creates a complete static website based on your choice of layouts.
